# webhookzSuck

Heroku fixie: 500 requests per month (or 100mb) after that will have to pay $5-20 per month.


Strange vulnerability: stopped listening to webhook! Had to change name of webhook to work again.
  Not sure if this is nationbuilder end or ours. Keep and eye out for this, if it goes totally silent then look into it.
